# Looping Pendulum Simulation

Stage1LoopingPendulum and Stage2LoopingPendulum solves the differential equations using Mathemaica's NDSolve. To use, simply execute in Mathematica Online.

Graphic Solution.py transforms the resultant dictionary of dicitonaries into a Python Arry to be graphed with matplotlib.pyplot.

The physical and numerical analysis is fully explained in the paper Looping Pendulum created by Alejandro Ruiz, David Fuquen, Juliana Rodriguez and Lucas Nieto
